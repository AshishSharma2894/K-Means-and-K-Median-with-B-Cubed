# K-Means-and-K-Median-with-B-Cubed
Here I implemented K-Means and K-Median clustering algorithms without the use of any in-build library except for NumPy and used Pandas only for data upload 

Here initially i am implementing K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster the instance into k clusters

Further moving ahead in the code I am implementing K-Median clustering algorithm to cluster the instance into k clusters

Furthermore we vary the value of K from 1 to 9 and compute B-Cubed precision, recall and F-Score for each set of cluster, to understand this more clearly
we have plotted k in horizontal axis and precision, recall and F-Score in vertical axis.

Moving Forward have applied same application in the K-Median and have calculated precision, recall and F-score for the different value of k

At last we implemented L2 Normalisation to the k-means and k-median and plotted the precision, recall and F-Score for same by normalising the vectors before clustering.

The Final Result from the code can be seen below in the graphs
